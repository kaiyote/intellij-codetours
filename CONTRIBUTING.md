## I Want to Contribute. How can I do that?

First off, check out our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). If you can't abide by that, please bugger off.

Now, with that out of the way.... Welcome! Glad to have you here. Just a few standards to cover and you'll be on your
way to contributing to this here whatever this is.

### Code Formatting
Let IntelliJ/Kotlin formatting whatever do it for you.

### PRs
You don't need to open an issue first. You can if you want to, but in my mind the PR is the invitation to discuss.
The PR should have a descriptive title, however, and it would be nice if you explained all the things in the body of the PR (we have a template to help you out there).

### Thats it.
This is a short doc. Don't be a dick, let dart formatter do its thing, be descriptive in PRs. That's about it!
